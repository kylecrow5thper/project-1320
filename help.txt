Student Accounts Format
-----------------------
Stored in students.txt:

1. Student ID
2. Student Name
3. Current Balance (stored as balanceDeposit)
   - Loaded from balance.txt and stored in students.txt
4. Semester Spending Limit
   - Asked one time during createAccount()
   - Cannot be changed afterwards
5. Total Spent This Semester
   - Calculated by spendMoney()
6. Optional: Routing Number for Withdrawals
   - Only needed if the student wants to use withdrawToBank()

SEPARATE FILE:
balance.txt
- A separate function/program will repeatedly ask the user to add or subtract money.
- Input continues until the user types "exit" (case insensitive).
- The final calculated balance is written to balance.txt.
- The main program reads this balance and saves it in the student's balanceDeposit field.

FILE LOADING AND SAVING:

loadAccounts("students.txt")
- Runs FIRST, immediately when the program starts.
- Opens students.txt and reads every line.

- Converts each line into a StudentAccount struct.
- Stores all student accounts in an in-memory array.
    ( Each line of students.txt is read as text (a string).
    That line is then split into pieces (ID, Name, Balance, etc.).
    Those pieces are put into a StudentAccount struct, filling its fields.
    That struct is placed into an array (like students[0], students[1], students[2]).
    The array holds all student accounts in memory while the program is running.
    )
- Required so that createAccount(), loginStudent(), spendMoney(), viewAccount(),
  and withdrawToBank() can all access existing user data.

saveAccounts("students.txt")
- Runs LAST, right before the program exits.
- Opens students.txt for writing.
- Writes every StudentAccount from memory back into the file.
- Ensures ALL changes made during the program are permanently saved.
- If students.txt does NOT exist, this function automatically CREATES it.

FUNCTIONS IN THE PROGRAM:

createAccount()
- Asks for Student ID, Name, semester spending limit, and routing number (optional).
- Initializes spentThisSem = 0.
- Loads balanceDeposit from balance.txt.
- Adds the new account to the in-memory array.
- Does NOT write to students.txt directly. Saving is handled later by saveAccounts().

loginStudent()
- Asks for a Student ID.
- Searches the array loaded by loadAccounts().
- Returns the index of the matching student.
- Used by studentMenu().

spendMoney(int studentIndex)
- Subtracts from balanceDeposit.
- Adds to spentThisSem.
- Checks if the student exceeds semLimit.
- Updates the in-memory student record.

viewAccount(int studentIndex)
- Displays:
  - Student ID
  - Name
  - balanceDeposit
  - semLimit
  - spentThisSem
  - remaining limit
  - routingNumber

withdrawToBank(int studentIndex)
- Uses routingNumber to simulate a bank withdrawal.
- If routingNumber is missing, displays an error.

approveClubTransaction()
- Simulates voting on club fund approval.
- Requires 2/3 majority.
- Does not modify students.txt.

studentMenu(int studentIndex)
- Menu shown after login.
- Calls:
  1. viewAccount()
  2. spendMoney()
  3. withdrawToBank()
  4. Logout

mainMenu()
- First menu in the program.
- Calls:
  1. createAccount()
  2. loginStudent() → studentMenu()
  3. approveClubTransaction()
  4. Exit (saveAccounts() is called at the end)

PROGRAM EXECUTION ORDER
-----------------------

1. Program starts.
2. loadAccounts("students.txt") runs FIRST
   - Loads all existing student accounts from students.txt
   - If the file does not exist, the program will later create it.

3. mainMenu() runs
   - User may choose:
     - createAccount()
     - loginStudent()
     - approveClubTransaction()
     - exit program
(use a switch case to get these to run)
